        <ol>
          <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Preheat a gas grill for high heat, or arrange charcoal briquettes on
            one side of the barbeque. Lightly oil the grate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small
            jar; close the lid and shake to mix.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trim the membrane sheath from the back of each rack. Run a small,
            sharp knife between the membrane and each rib, and snip off the
            membrane as much as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle as much of the rub onto both sides of ribs as desired. To
            prevent ribs from becoming too dark and spicy, do not thoroughly rub
            spices into ribs. Store any unused spice mix in a jar for future
            use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place aluminum foil on the lower rack to capture drippings and
            prevent flare-ups. Lay ribs on the top rack of the grill (away from
            the coals, if you're using briquettes). Reduce gas heat to low and
            close the lid; cook ribs, undisturbed as possible, until meat pulls
            away easily from the bone, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Brush ribs with barbecue sauce, and grill for an additional 5
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve ribs as a whole rack, or cut between each rib bone and pile
            individually on a platter.
          </li>
